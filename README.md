# NOTE:
**I NO LONGER USE GITHUB. You can see my profile [here](https://git.topcheto.eu/topchetoeu) instead.**

Why? I wanted to remove as many Microsoft products from my life as possible, and GitHub, unfortunately, is one of these producst. I strongly advice you to do the same. My profile will remain as an archive for anybody with an outdated link to be able to see.

# Who am I
  - A C/C++ low-level developer
  - A web developer
  - A Minecraft mod developer
  - A nerd for everything computer-related  
# Some highlights of my work:
  - Animated chunks (a somewhat popular mod for animations of chunk loading, almost completed)
  - NiceOS (an experiment of making my own OS, on hold until I finish the ++C compiler)
  - ++C (custom language, currently in development)
